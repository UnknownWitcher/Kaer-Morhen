## PARSYNC
I wanted to learn how to create multiprocessing and threading using python and thought rsync would be a good way to test this out,
I have only used the basic rsync features involving two local paths, I do not know if it will work with ssh or any other functions.

Logging is also console only so if you want to store the log in a file then mod the code to include this or pipe it.

### How to use
Bottom of the script, add your paths to the source and destination, default flags are -av but feel free to expirement.

### NOTICE
I am not responsible for how you use this, for me this was just something to play with as a means to learn, so use at your own risk.
